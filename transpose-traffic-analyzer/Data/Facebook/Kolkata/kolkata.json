Stringent enforcement  through prosecution strictly in adherence to rules are made whenever contravention is detected to have deterrence. It shall also be imperative to mention that plain clothed police personnel masquerading as passengers  contributed in a significant manner too  to nab errant drivers , culminating in a plethora of prosecution cases registered against multifarious offences ranging from R/C violation, to misbehavior, refusals, overcharging, plying shuttle etc. KTP is aware that such drives have to be sustained with greater intensity in future too and officers are committed & relentlessly striving to render more exquisite service to the esteemed citizens of the city . Zero tolerance  measures are adopted to rein in rogue/reckless drivers so as to  eradicate the menace in its totality. Sharing  some of the random snapshots which are taken during our drive last week wherein  a team of handpicked officers are seen  conducting drives against errant  taxis. Regards, team KTP.",

    "message": "Inviting kind attention of the esteemed members of this page. The Facebook page of Kolkata Traffic Police now boasts of a membership of close to 55,000 of well-wishing citizens. The rate of growth in membership has been very encouraging and active participation of the citizens has helped this page evolve into an effective enforcement tool on one hand, and a medium for meaningful self-introspection and development on the other. Some of the members may be aware that with a view to making the platform more participatory and the interaction a little more structured, we had organised three sessions of ''Facebook Friends' Forum'' over the last two years and a half wherein around 150/160 members had face-to-face interactions with senior officers of Kolkata Traffic Police at Lalbazar, the Kolkata Police Headquarters. The idea was to have a frank and no-holds barred exchange of views and find ways to improve traffic management in this beloved city of ours. The first three sessions witnessed overwhelming response and many useful suggestions came from members which were duly implemented.\n\nWe propose to hold the forth session of ''Facebook Friends' Forum'' on Saturday, 02.08.2014 at Lalbazar at 03:30 PM. Since sparing time on weekdays would obviously be difficult for the members, the interaction, as on the last three occasions, has been scheduled on a Saturday. Would humbly request members willing to participate to share their address and phone numbers/e-mail id latest within 19.07.2014 so that we can send official invitations in advance. The number of members we can accommodate is a maximum of 100 and hence priority will have to be accorded to those who confirm their participation early. Please also indicate your mode of conveyance so that we can make necessary parking arrangements. For any further queries, you may post/mail on/to the KTP FB page or contact Insp. Tridip Datta (9830449956/octcc@kolkatatrafficpolice.gov.in) or Insp. Nilesh Choudhury (98302-44145/nilesh1304@gmail.com) or Sgt Sudipto Mukherjee (98368-63377/sudipto.pri@gmail.com) or Sgt Indrajit Dutta (9830052765/indrajitdutta@live.in).\n\nThe support of the citizens, we have always maintained, is our principal source of sustenance and we hope this venture of ours would also be blessed with your support and encouragement. Let us all work together for a ''faster, safer, friendlier'' Kolkata.\n\nThanks and warm regards from Team KTP",

    "message": "Inviting kind attention of the esteemed members of this page. The Facebook page of Kolkata Traffic Police now boasts of a membership of close to 55,000 of well-wishing citizens. The rate of growth in membership has been very encouraging and active participation of the citizens has helped this page evolve into an effective enforcement tool on one hand, and a medium for meaningful self-introspection and development on the other. Some of the members may be aware that with a view to making the platform more participatory and the interaction a little more structured, we had organised three sessions of ''Facebook Friends' Forum'' over the last two years and a half wherein around 150/160 members had face-to-face interactions with senior officers of Kolkata Traffic Police at Lalbazar, the Kolkata Police Headquarters. The idea was to have a frank and no-holds barred exchange of views and find ways to improve traffic management in this beloved city of ours. The first three sessions witnessed overwhelming response and many useful suggestions came from members which were duly implemented.\n\nWe propose to hold the forth session of ''Facebook Friends' Forum'' on Saturday, 02.08.2014 at Lalbazar at 03:30 PM. Since sparing time on weekdays would obviously be difficult for the members, the interaction, as on the last three occasions, has been scheduled on a Saturday. Would humbly request members willing to participate to share their address and phone numbers/e-mail id latest within 19.07.2014 so that we can send official invitations in advance. The number of members we can accommodate is a maximum of 100 and hence priority will have to be accorded to those who confirm their participation early. Please also indicate your mode of conveyance so that we can make necessary parking arrangements. For any further queries, you may post/mail on/to the KTP FB page or contact Insp. Tridip Datta (9830449956/octcc@kolkatatrafficpolice.gov.in) or  Insp. Nilesh Choudhury (98302-44145/nilesh1304@gmail.com) or Sgt Sudipto Mukherjee (98368-63377/sudipto.pri@gmail.com) or Sgt Indrajit Dutta (9830052765/indrajitdutta@live.in).\n\nThe support of the citizens, we have always maintained, is our principal source of sustenance and we hope this venture of ours would also be blessed with your support and encouragement. Let us all work together for a ''faster, safer, friendlier'' Kolkata.\n\nThanks and warm regards from Team KTP",

This year too, Team KTP has tried its level-best to live up to the challenge and made an all-out round-the-clock effort to keep the city traffic smooth and hassle-free during the Puja days of Sasthi to Navami. The seemingly endless waves of crowd coupled with the severely hostile weather on Ashtami and Navami made it all the more challenging for us this year. Whether  we have been able to meet the expectations or not... to what extent we could succeed and to what extent we could not...it is for the people of this beloved city of ours to judge. All we can humbly submit is that we tried our heart and soul to deliver. Feedback from the citizens about their puja traffic experience is most welcome. While your words of praise will bolster our spirit and make us feel that all the effort has been worth it, your criticism, needless to add, is also most welcome so that we can try to improve in the years to come.  As we gear up for immersion duties, we also take this opportunity to convey our grateful thanks to the citizens for extending their cooperation during the Pujas. Wishing Subho Bijaya to all once again from all members of Team Kolkata Traffic Police. \nThanks and regards",

We are privileged to have students of as many as 111 schools across the length and breadth of this beloved city of ours participating in the campaign. Hand in hand with KTP, schoolchildren will make a sincere effort to sensitize citizens about the dangers of sound pollution caused by unnecessary honking through placards, posters, banners in the vicinity of schools, hospitals and important crossings. While our anti-pollution cell and special raid section do hold raids against unnecessary honking on a regular basis, we are aware that as is the case with most traffic violations, mere enforcement is not the solution unless coupled with awareness campaigns . Hence in addition to our routine enforcement drives, we have sought the help of schoolchildren throughout the city to make the city motorists a little more aware and sensitive to the menace of sound pollution. Let us all join hands to make our city roads free from unnecessary honking. Thanks and regards from Team KTP.",

As we had mentioned in our earlier posts in this regard, we can accommodate a maximum of 70 members due to constraints of space and time. We are, therefore, unable to invite more than 70 willing members though many more have volunteered to participate. We have accorded preference to those who have not attended our earlier meetings and to those who have responded to our post the earliest. Formal invitations are being sent to 70 members through mail/phone to attend the forum on 13.07.2013 at 03.30 PM at Traffic Conference Room, Traffic Building, Lalbazar.

Ave, one of them is just is little west of Gariahat Crossing on R.B. Ave. Due to that pit of sewerage work the black top space is very narrow at the same point, if the Autos those who are availing R.V.

Also for your information that from traffic point of view there is a Traffic signal board for not to take U turn from that point except Autos. Thanks.",

    "message": "@ Amritendu Sen Gupta\u2026\u2026Your post on 2nd September 2012, read\u2026\u201d Sharing an experiences.Today I was getting my car fixed at EM.BYPASS bidhanshiudhan X ng at around 11.30am.There were 2 sergeants who were checking vehicles along with a home guard and a so called civilian.At around 11.45am they stopped a couple as the pillion rider was not wearing helmet.The sergeant politely informed them about the importance of helmet. I saw that the While they were speaking the home guard and so called civil dressed police started to check the papers of the 2 wheeler I approached and asked who he was & why he is doing the job of police when a sergeant is present.I was stunned to hear that the so called civil dressed police was a normal civilian.I immidietly protested to the concerned sergeant and demanded to know how he is allowing a local boy to check 2 wheeler documents? Upon hearing this the hooligan who was doing police duty abused me verbally and with his fingers pointed at me started abusing in front of the sergeant.The picture attached is of the hooligan police.SO ARE YOU SO CRUNCH IN MANPOWER THAT NOW A DAYS LOCAL HOOLIGANS ARE DOING POLICE DUTY?Along with him was a home guard who said his name was Tubai Karmakar and his TP NO-30336.This person was also shouting along with the hooligan. Couldn't get the name of the sergeant How ever The police bike number was-WB-01-X-2232.Date2/09/12.time 11.45am.My question is how can a person who is nowhere attached with the police stop vehicle and check papers that too in front of a sergeant?requesting strict action at the earliest. Regards\u201d\n\nThis is to bring your kind notice that we had initiated a thorough enquiry based on your complaint and found that the name of person in green T-shirt is Bidyut Parika who is a home-guard attached to Kolkata police and was performing duty in plain- cloth and person performing duty in uniform was ASI Ashok Kumar Palai of Maniktala PS, who was deployed from Maniktala PS regarding raid against unruly drivers. KTP apart, the local police stations also hold vehicle-checking exercises regularly and at times in civil dress too for infusing a surprise element. There might have been some communication-gap which had led you into believing that civilians were being entrusted police jobs. That was not the fact. They were KP personnel, let alone being hooligans. Having said that, the misbehaviour of those on duty that you have alleged about is unacceptable. The concerned DCP has been requested to enquire into the misbehaviour aspect and take needful action.Thanks and regards from Team KTP.",

It is heartening to note that when the year began, the membership figures hovered just around 5000-odd, but over the last six months, the figures have gone up at a progressively ascending rate and before we knew it, the 'likes' shot up to 13000 by mid-july and as we approach mid-September the KTP Facebook page boasts of the support of no less than 20 K and more importantly, has evolved into an effective enforcement tool for us ! While on one hand, it is a matter of satisfaction for the KTP family that more and more citizens of this beloved city of ours are reposing their faith on us, whereas on the other, the ever-growing membership makes us more aware of the expectations of the people we serve and the responsibility that comes with it. Since the inception of this page, we have always maintained that we are open to all kinds of views/suggestions/criticism/observations and that is exactly what the page is meant for.......making a sincere effort towards better traffic management through meaningful interaction with the citizens. Managing the city traffic day in and day out, we are sure our members will kindly appreciate, is quite a challenging, if not thankless, job. We have been trying hard to address the major areas of concern for the citizens by a careful analysis of the posts ; at times we succeed, and on many occasions we fail, but kindly trust us, we never cease trying to make a difference, however small that may be. Encouraging words strengthen our resolve to be persistent with our efforts, criticism makes us more aware of our shortcomings ; we at KTP try to take both in our stride and seek to improve therefrom. This page derives its source of sustenance, more than anything else, from the active participation of its members and we take this opportunity to offer our grateful thanks to each and every member.

    "message": "Some members have of late observed that this page is turning into a redressal forum for taxi-refusals only and the other issues are ignored or not accorded due attention to. Kindly allow us to submit our views. The number of complaints about a particular issue on this page, as we perceive them, are broadly indicative of the gravity of the same and the extent to which it affects the citizenry who are members of our FB family. Going by that yardstick,if we go by a rough percentage measure, about 65 % of the posts per month relate to taxi-refusal, 15% about chaotic auto-driving, 5% about pollution-related issues like smoke-emission and honking, 5% about traffic rule violations by police, 5% relate to illegal parking and signal-pulse issues and the remaining 5% about area-specific miscellaneous matters. These, we reiterate, are rough percentages which have not shown any significant variation over the last few months. The responses to the taxi-refusa\nl complaints, as a result, will naturally outnumber responses on other issues. Having said that, let us humbly submit that if you notice carefully, other areas of concern too are responded to with due priority but those posts probably get overshadowed by the sheer numerical prowess of our taxi-refusal responses. We have never claimed to have addressed all issues to the satisfaction of citizens, but just for the sake of record, taxi-refusal is not the sole issue this page seeks to address. We may upload a good number of photos/statistics of the anti-honking/anti-pollution prosecutions done daily and the raids against illegal parking at violation-prone spots as also the action-taken reports in respect of violations by police personnel, but that just might seem an exercise in self-patting. One may argue that the same logic should apply for taxi-refusal raids and why snapshots of our anti-refusal drives are uploaded regularly. Our humble response is that as per available statistics of the posts on this page and a careful analysis of the same, taxi-refusal is a problem that affects the netizenry of this page most and it is our duty to assure them that their complaints are duly acted upon by sharing regularly the highlights of our actions. We have been trying to address the taxi-refusal posts sincerely, but not at the expense of other posts. It is difficult to deliver instant justice to all posts since necessary enquiries and legal processes have to be adhered to and that consumes time. We are sorry and apologize for the delayed response in some cases, but the delay is not due to lack of attention/priority to a particular issue. \nThanks and regards from Team KTP.",

Over the last couple of days, our teams focussed on Gilander House, Canning street-Brabourne Road crossing, Dalhousie area in general, Camac Street-Shakespeare Sarani crossing, Girish Park, Hazra crossing, Minto Park, College Street, to name a few stretches, resulting in 53 prosecutions against errant taxi-drives who were caught off-guard. Punitive actions ranging from prosecutions to temporary cancellation of licenses have followed.  As we have always maintained, curbing the menace of taxi-refusal completely may be a far cry, but sustained enforcement will surely make a difference in the long run.

The idea was to reduce the ever-increasing burden of pending cases on one hand, and providing people with a hassle-free single-window mechanism to settle their long-pending dues on account of traffic violations. A special team under the leadership of Shri Dipankar Sengupta, Assistant Commissioner, TP and Shri Manoj Kumar Das, OC Fatal Squad, Shri Tridip Datta, OC Traffic Computer Cell, Shri K K Bhattacharjee, OC MTV toiled day and night over the last one month to make this possible.

At around 15 35 hours today, at the crossing of Bagmari Road and CIT Road, while an elderly lady was walking along the footpath of CIT Road from North to South, two miscreants on a motorcycle, moving in the same direction, attempted to snatch the gold-chain of the lady. The lady was caught unawares, almost fell down and the chain broke into pieces. Shri Maniklal Murmu, performing beat duty at the crossing, ran towards the motorcycle which was trying to speed away, caught hold of the pillion-rider,pushed him and managed to get the driver off balance as the motorcycle fell by the wayside. Local public rushed in , helped apprehend the two miscreants who were handed over soon after to Maniktala Police Station wherein a specific criminal case has been registered under appropriate sections of law. The motorcycle has been seized. Shri Murmu sustained minor injuries in the process. He has been suitably rewarded immediately thereafter by the Commissioner of Police. We are proud of Shri Murmu. May there be more like him ! Regards from Team KTP.",

As part of our continuous  anti-refusal drives by our plain-clothed special raid teams in disguise of passengers, we focussed on these areas yesterday evening. As many as 39 taxi-drivers were caught unawares, resulting in prosecution and seizure of license followed by temporary suspension of the same. Posted herewith are some snapshots of our teams in action. Changing  the mindset and behavioural patterns of the 30000-odd taxi-drivers in the city overnight may be a far cry, but we shall keep trying to make a difference to the best extent possible. We are aware that refusal complaints in substantial numbers are still pouring in and hence the drives shall continue in a sustained manner.Kindly post taxi-refusal complaints on this page with details of taxi-no, place and time or complain telephonically at 1073. You may also please spare some time to suggest other 'hot-spots' for taxi-refusal so as to help us zero in. Thanks and regards for the support and encouragement from Team KTP.",

    "message": "@ Subhajoy Roy\u2026. your FB complaint on 25.07.2012 read\u2026\u2026\u201d Last night i faced two refusals, one from a taxi driver and another from a policeman in traffic control room. i was returning home after work with my colleagues and we were looking for taxis around 9pm.\r\nseveral taxis refused to go and we didn't object to that. i asked one taxi (WB04B 1064) in front of E-mall (Central Avenue--Madan Street crossing) and it agreed to go. my colleagues were supposed to go to Garia and i had said that. the moment i called my colleagues, who were standing some distance away, to come, the driver asked how many of us were there. i said four and he instantly demanded Rs 400. this irritated me and i became determined that i won't give that amount.\r\ni asked one colleague to get inside the taxi. as he opened the door, the driver sped up and tried to flee. i opened the front left door and jumped into the taxi while it was moving. the driver didn't stop.\r\nthe driver took the first left turn from Madan Street and took the taxi inside Chandni Chowk. this time i was afraid as i was alone inside the cab. my colleagues were running after the cab.\r\nwhile i was inside, the driver repeated, \"jeta bollam shunecho. 400 taka lagbe. etai raat e jawar niyom.\"\r\nby now i had called up the traffic control room and started narrating the incident. the driver seemed a bit afraid when i called police and stopped the car.\r\nTCR was co-operative the first time. the policeman on phone asked me the location of the taxi and wanted the vehicle's number. he told me not to leave the car and promised to send an officer to the spot.\r\ni had to get down to note the vehicle's number, since the number written inside was smudged. as expected, the driver fled with the car as soon as i got down. but i managed to give the number. the call got disconnected.\r\nby now, my colleagues, who were running after the taxi had arrived. we again went back in front of E-mall. one of my colleague, Monalisa Chaudhuri, called TCR to lodge a complaint. but she was told that TCR cannot take such a complaint. she was directed to call 1073.\r\nwe left the matter and started looking for a new cab. soon we found one. inside the new cab, we sat silently for about three minutes. then i again called TCR, to ask why they wouldn't take the complaint.\r\nas i said, \"dada amader ekta taxi refusal hoyeche\", the policeman on phone said, \"apni ke.\" when i said i am a commuter, he shouted, \"dada bolchen kake. apni apnar dada-tada hoy na.\"\r\nhis behaviour made me angry and i shouted back. i asked him what is wrong if i call a policeman \"dada\". i also asked him why he wouldn't take the complaint.\r\naccording to my phone call records, this call was made at 9.20pm. the clock in my mobile phone is about 8 minutes fast.\r\nthe argument grew and i told him that i will write a detailed account on facebook saying that TCR refused to take comlplaint. he mellowed down immediately. he started saying, \"dada ami complaint nebo na bolini, ami apnake ar ekta number e ph korte bolechi.\"\r\ni cut the phone on his face.\r\nmy question is can't a commuter call a policeman/woman dada? and can't police take a complaint and do the needful on their own than directing the victim to another number.\r\nand is there a rule that TCR cannot take taxi refusal complaint that this policeman told me?\u201d. This is to inform you that Debendra Barik the offending driver has been brought to book followed by prosecution and temporary cancellation of license. As for the response of TCR, concerned officer has been briefed adequately by senior officers.",

    "message": "We are in receipt of many posts/complaints of late regarding traffic snarls during peak office hours along the stretch from Chingrighata to Parama Island and further west to Park Circus 7-point as also on EM Bypass from Ruby to Parama and further north. We are aware of the same . Kindly allow us to submit the reasons thereof. Commuters along that route must surely be aware that the work of the elevated corridor along the Park Circus connector is on in full swing and the road space has got reduced by more than half while the traffic volume is on the rise day-by-day. Add to that the blockades on the southern flank of New Park Street near 4 no bridge for the emergency work of essential underground utility services, further reducing the available road space. The Kohinoor Market crossing and the Gobinda Khatik crossing are the two major bottlenecks. A huge pier of the elevated corridor is coming up at the former while the pedestrian crossovers at the latter are taking more time than usual due to the limited space. Since a bulk of vehicles proceeding eastward from 7 point to Parama usually move southward along Topsia Road (South) from Kohinoor Market crossing, the right turn has to be allowed frequently and while it is done, the East-bound traffic gets tailed up on one hand due to absence of another lane-space and the West-bound traffic from Parama too gets halted. Further, the north-bound traffic from Ruby to Parama along EM Bypass also has bof late been suffering due to the poor condition of the rain-hit service roads which most vehicles are not inclined to take. Synchronizing the east and west-bound traffic by way of according proportionate preference to both depending on the real-time traffic volume is what we are trying to do to the best possible extent. Additional manpower has been deployed, but we are sure that you would appreciate that the road space vis-a-vis the volume of traffic cannot be effectively redressed by mere augmentation of traffic personnel. These are not excuses, we are trying our best within the given constraints; but the ground realities are such that this traffic congestion is something we possibly have to bear with for some more time. We expect things to improve for the better within a fortnight's time.We are pursuing hard with the different agencies to complete as much of the ongoing work as early as possible and the agencies too are working overtime. Kindly bear with us. Apologies to the commuters for the inconvenience. Thanks and regards, Team KTP",

    "message": "The Taratala- Thakurpukur stretch, we could gather from feedback/complaints, happens to be one of the more violation-prone stretches ( close to 3000 autos ply along this stretch) as far as indisciplined auto-driving is concerned. Apart from the common allegations regarding indisciplined/dangerous driving, indiscriminate parking, carrying excess passengers etc, one of the most recurring complaints along this stretch is about route-truncation with autos refusing to go the entire distance and resorting to short-distance break-journeys. The Diamond Harbour Road Traffic Guard, over the last month, under the leadership of Shri Alok Sanyal, OC , Diamond harbour Traffic Guard,has launched hundreds of prosecutions against autos and a sizeable quantity among them being against route-truncation ( u/s 66/192 MV Act ). The local traffic guard is trying hard to improve the sense of road-discipline among the auto-drivers. Flexes / hoardings have been put up in strategic places displaying the phone-numbers of the local traffic guard where citizens may call and lodge telephonic complaints about auto-refusals, route truncation etc. A good number of prosecutions have been launched so far on the basis of telephonic complaints. Humbly requesting the commuters along this route to note down the number of the offending auto and post it on this page or call the local guard office at 2479-8210 / 24883872 to help us take lawful action. Posting herewith a few snapshots of a special drive by DH Traffic Guard over the last couple of days. Thanks and regards from Team KTP.",

    "message": "We had received quite a few complaints in the recent past, through this page and otherwise as well, regarding poor traffic management in and around Laxmipat Singhania School near Judges Court Road and Alipore Road crossing particularly during the morning hours when the school opens. Many had expressed concern about the safety of the school-children, attributing the same to chaotic and haphazard movement of cars carrying the students. Managing traffic during the opening and closing hours of most of the major schools in the city  is indeed a daunting task, given the unusually huge vehicular/pedestrian traffic volume within a very short time-span of 15/20 minutes, locational variables ( while some are bang on the road, some are housed in narrow lanes and some in the vicinity of extermely busy crossings), inadequate parking space, absence of specific entry and exit roads, big schoolbuses fighting for space with two-wheelers, four-wheelers and even taxis/autos etc. Having said that, we have been trying to bring out improvement, however little  that may be, in managing school-hour traffic by way of extra deployment from within our limited resources and working out innovative circulation flow to the extent possible. OC South-West Traffic Guard, for example, has been able to bring about some discipline in the vicinity of Laxmipat Singhania School during the opening hours through persistent efforts. Many of the parents have written to us complimenting the efforts. The school management too has appreciated the move. Here is a copy a letter from the Principal of the school acknowledging the endeavour. We request the members to kindly come up with practically implementable suggestions with regard to better traffic management during the opening/closing hours of schools.While nothing much can immediately be done about the vehicular/pedestrian traffic volume and the number of students, suggestions pertaining to safety of school/home-bound children will be most welcome. Thanks and regards from Team KTP.",

The call-takers at the TCR are being repeatedly briefed from time to time to respond to all calls timely and be extremely patient and polite while responding to the callers. Though we do not usually receive too many complaints about unwarranted behaviour by the TCR staff, we still thought that imparting some specialised training about soft-skills and telephone-etiquette might be of great help to them in serving the citizens in a more efficient and friendly manner. A four-day capsule course on \u201c Soft skills and telephone etiquette'' is currently under way at TCR and is being conducted by Sangshaptak Management Services, a professional consultant firm . Here are a couple of captures of the workshop in session. We are hopeful that this will help in further honing the behavioural and conversational skills of the personnel manning the TCR where the phone never stops ringing !

    "message": "Curbing the indisciplined and chaotic driving by a substantial section of the 20,000 plus auto-drivers in the city is quite a challenging task for KTP. We have, however, been sincerely trying to improve things by focussing on certain violation-prone stretches systematically . The Gariahat-Golpark sector is one such stretch wherefrom a large number of complaints regularly pour in. Apart from other violations, most of these refer to the tendency of autos making abrupt u-turns near Gariahat crossing from cut-outs wherefrom such roundabouts are prohibited. Sustained vigil and repeated prosecutions have curbed the menace of late to a reasonable extent. We don't claim to have ensured a violation-free sector ; habits die hard and some drivers still continue to take a chance to hoodwink us in the lean traffic hours, but by and large, a greater degree of road discipline has been enforced through a large number of prosecutions launched recently by South-East Traffic Guard in and around Gariahat crossing against signal violation, dangerous driving , stop-line violation, centre-line violation, indiscriminate parking,permit violation etc. Intensive enforcement apart, we are also planning to hold area-wise workshops for auto-drivers soon with a view to sensitize them about driving norms and adherence to traffic norms. Efforts may not yield dramatic results overnight, but we shall keep trying whole-heartedly. Here are a few snapshots of law catching up with errant auto-driving. Thanks for the support.

This is definitely one of the largest-ever disposal figures in a single day by a single court anywhere in the country and most certainly the largest-ever traffic case disposal in the state in a day. The idea was to reduce the ever-increasing burden of pending cases on one hand, and providing people with a hassle-free single-window mechanism to settle their long-pending dues on account of traffic violations. A special team under the leadership of Shri Dipankar Sengupta, Assistant Commissioner, TP and Shri Manoj Kumar Das, OC Fatal Squad, Shri Tridib Datta, OC Traffic Computer Cell, Shri Amitava Guha, OC Raid  toiled day and night over the last one month to make this possible.

We assure the members most emphatically that such drives shall continue regularly and with even greater intensity. Posted hereinabove are few snapshots of some offending taxi-drivers who had probably started believing that they were above law and could get away with their whims. Our plain-clothed teams masquerading as passengers yesterday evening/night took them by surprise and needless to add, altogether 35 of them were strictly dealt with (Prosecutions/ Licence-suspension).  Let us also humbly state that we keep posting these snaps not to beat our own trumpet; the only purpose is to keep assuring the citizens that KTP is trying with all its might to curb the menace. Let us reiterate that these drives are held at least once a week and shall continue in right earnest without any let-up. Kindly keep posting taxi-refusal complaints. Trust us, all complaints are acted upon to the best extent possible. \r\nThanks and regards from Team KTP.",

    "message": "Many of the members have of late been wondering aloud as to whether KTP has plans to launch drives against errant autos on similar lines of our taxi-refusal raids and have suggested that we should focus serious attention on autos too. This is to humbly inform members that regular prosecutions are launched against auto-rickshaws too for dangerous driving, refusals, route-truncation, carrying excess passengers, misbehaviour etc. That a lot more needs to be done in a sustained manner is borne out by the complaints we receive regularly on this page. An analysis of the posts on this page as also the complaints we receive through other sources revealed that the stretch from Taratala to Thakurpukur is one of the most troublesome ones in respect of indisciplined/erratic/whimsical auto-driving. Special attention has been accorded to this stretch in  a focussed manner over the last fortnight on a daily basis by Diamond Harbour Traffic Guard and Thakurpukur Traffic Guard. One of the members had actually taken the pains of noting down the number of a few autos which are in the habit of regularly indulging in route-truncation and posted on this page. This is to inform the esteemed members that over the last few days, as many as 17 autos in the concerned stretch have been prosecuted under 66 (1)/ 192 MV Act ( driving without permit or in contravention with the permit conditions ) which entails a fine of Rs 3000/- . A slip mentioning the phone number of DH Road Traffic Guard has been circulated locally in large numbers so that passengers can complain about auto-refusals and other allied violations. Flexes  have also been put up  at Behala Chowrasta, Behala Tram Depot and Ajanta cinema mentioning similar details. The feedback and support from the local citizenry has been very encouraging . The drives will continue. We shall gradually focus in a concerted fashion on other areas of the city too to bring about disciplined auto-driving to the best extent possible. We are aware that it would take   intense efforts over a substantial period of time to bring about large-scale improvement. Kindly keep posting about auto-related issues. We shall try our best to improve things. Thanks and regards from Team KTP.",

    "message": "Here are some random captures of a few taxi-drivers who were caught redhanded in the act of refusal yesterday during a special day-long drive by our handpicked plain-clothed teams. The teams  fanned out across the city with focus on Tollygunge Metro and Tollygunge Tram Depot, Park Street-Camac Street, Lindsay Street, South City, Mani Square, Coal India( Dalhousie), Ruby crossing, RN Tagore Hospital, Sealdah station complex.....just to mention a few. A total of 32 drivers were booked with punitive actions ranging from prosecutions/ licence-suspension. Such drives are being held for the last few months, at least once a week, resulting in all-time high prosecution figures against taxi-refusal. The magnitude of the problem, we are aware, cannot be drastically lessened overnight unless we continue to sustain our vigil with the same intensity.  Amidst the day-to-day unenviable challenge of traffic management in an ever-growing metropolis (in terms of population and vehicles alike), combating taxi-refusal is something we shall continue to accord due priority to. Thanks for the support and encouragement.Wishing all a safe and happy weekend. Warm regards. \r\nSupratim Sarkar Joint CP ( Traffic )",

    "message": "Here goes yet another example of law catching up with the offender in reasonably quick time. The Telegraph this morning has carried another first-hand account of yet another disturbing incident of taxi-refusal and subsequent misbehaviour . This matter was reported at 9 30 pm on saturday to traffic control room telephonically on 1073 soon after the incident and our special raid section under the leadership of Inspector Monoj Kumar Das sprang into action immediately. Tracking him down turned out to be a little more difficult than we had thought as he played elusive for more than 72 hours till KTP could finally lay his hands on him this afternoon. Md Irfan, the offending driver, was arrested about an hour back from Topsia area and his licence has been suspended for six months. Many of our esteemed members, while reacting to our earlier post a few days back regarding a similar arrest, had opined that mere suspension of licence is not a strong enough deterrent. We humbly submit that within the existing legal provisions,  this is the most stringent punitive action KTP can initiate. This apart, some had felt in the same vein that KTP reacts more promptly only on incidents  highlighted by the media. Let us humbly state that we accord same priority to all taxi-refusal complaints, notwithstanding whether they are received through facebook, 1073 or the media. Since the beginning of this year, licences of hundreds of errant drivers have been suspended and prosecutions have been launched in thousands, more than treble the comparative figures last year during the same period. We, however, are aware that there's still a long way to go towards our aim of minimising the problem to the best extent possible. Please keep posting complaints of taxi-refusal on this page or kindly ring 1073 mentioning the date, time and taxi number. We shall keep trying our best.          \r\nWarm regards....Supratim Sarkar , Joint CP Traffic",

    "message": "Here is the photograph of Md Shamim, an errant taxi-driver whom the law has caught up with. Many of you have must have gone through the first-hand account in today's The Telegraph about the torment that two ladies had to undergo recently on account of refusal and subsequent misbehaviour by a taxi driver (WB-04D-8722). Many of the members have rightly voiced their concern and anguish over the incident and urged us to take proper punitive action against the offender. We are happy to inform that the special raid team of KTP has been on the job from  early this morning and has been able to nab the offending driver( Md. Shamim) from Kashipore area a little while ago. The driver has been prosecuted as per relevant provisions of law and his license has been suspended for a period of six months. While it is quite a daunting task to keep a tab on the behavioural patterns of more than 30,000 taxi-drivers round-the-clock day in and day out across the length and breadth of the city, the drives against taxi-refusal at particularly vulnerable points are on and will continue in right earnest. KTP is trying its level-best to curb the menace. Kindly post on this page (along with date, time and taxi number ) whenever you are refused by a taxi or ring 1073 (toll-free number of traffic control room ) so as to help us initiate action. Warm regards.\r\n\r\nSupratim Sarkar \r\n\r\nJoint CP (Traffic)",

Sergeant Samrat  Dhali of Vidyasagar Setu Traffic Guard,while performing duty on Vidyasagar Setu on 23.6.12, had spotted an elderly gentleman in almost a state of unconsciousness in one of the window seats in a private bus of Alambazar-Duttafulia route while it was stuck in a signal. He sensed that something could be wrong with the gentleman , promptly boarded the bus and could gather that the person was in serious respiratory distress and his body had got stiffened. He thereafter arranged to carry the indisposed gentleman down from the bus, got hold of a taxi standing nearby, placed him therein and escorted the taxi to Central Medical Research Institute in Ekbalpore all by himself. On reaching the hospital, Sgt  Dhali prevailed on the medical staff to arrange for his immediate admission to ICCU. The attending doctors opined that the ailing person had suffered a cardiac attack and a little more delay in treatment could have proved fatal. While the preliminary treatment was on, Sgt Dhali could gather from the call-list of his cellphone that the gentleman , a resident of Salt Lake, works as an accounts executive in a Howrah branch of Union Bank and informed his colleagues, wife and daughter about the incident. His near and dear ones arrived soon after. The gentleman , we are relieved to learn , is on his way to recovery. The photograph posted herewith shows Sgt Dhali being felicitated by senior officers of Kolkata Traffic Police for his rare act of humanism which has done the entire force proud. He is being recommended for Commissioner of Police's 'Silver Disc' , an award most prestigious in Kolkata Police. May there be many more like you , Samrat!\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: Shri Subir Kumar Ghosh, OC , Vidyasagar Setu , Traffic Guard, Shri Dilip Adak,DC(Traffic), Shri Supratim Sarkar ,Joint CP (Traffic), Shri Samrat Dhali , Sri Soumen Mitra , Addl CP(II).",

    "message": "Inviting kind attention of our esteemed members. This is in reference to our post a few days back regarding constituting a '' facebook friends' forum'' wherein willing members would have a fortnightly/monthly face-to-face interaction  with the senior officers of Kolkata Traffic Police to discuss/share  views/suggestions/criticisms for improving traffic management in the city. The response, to say the least, has been overwhelming. Our heartfelt thanks and gratitude to all those who have kindly volunteered to participate and also to those who have had encouraging words for the venture. We propose to hold the first interactive session this Saturday, 16.6.12,  at Briefing Room, Lalbazar at 4 PM. Mails/ telephone calls will go from our end in the form of a formal invitation to the members who have volunteered so far to participate. Since the time that the members would be sparing on a weekend is precious,we would ideally want to limit the duration of the interaction/discussion to a maximum of one and a half hour / two hours . It would, therefore , be helpful if the participants come prepared with their views/observations/suggestions etc so as to make optimum use of the available time. Would remain grateful if the members could please confirm their participation by mailing at octcc@kolkatatrafficpolice.gov.in.  Would further request members to indicate their modes of conveyance so that we could make necessary parking arrangements. For any further queries, members may mail at the afore-mentioned mail id or contact Sgt Nilesh Choudhury ( 9830244145/ nilesh1304@gmail.com), Sgt Sudipto Mukherjee (9836863377/  sudipto.pri@gmail.com) . Would also request members to please try to reach Lalbazar by 3 45 PM on the scheduled date so that we could start the session sharp at 4 PM. Our officers and men will be present at the main  gate to facilitate the entry and parking. Please do spare some time from your busy schedules to make Kolkata a 'faster, safer and friendlier' city. It merits mention here that  in the inaugural session this Saturday we would be inviting only those who had volunteered to participate till date. The forum, however, remains open. Esteemed members willing to participate in the next session ( in the month of July) may please share their phone no/mail id so that we could invite them therein. Kolkata Traffic Police is eagerly looking forward to a meaningful interaction with the members of this fast-growing FB page. Thanks and warmest regards. \n\nSupratim Sarkar\n\nJoint CP ( Traffic )",

    "message": "The Traffic Lokadalat  organised last Saturday at Sealdah Court has been a hugely successful one. A total of 10 courts functioned simultaneously to dispose  long-pending traffic violation cases, both pre-litigation and post-litigation ones. A total of 34,852 (an all-time record) cases were disposed in a day resulting in a realisation of revenue worth more than Rs 19 lakh to the Government through the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate.  The process involved months of painstaking spadework with the judiciary and meticulous record-building by a team of officers of MTV (minor traffic violations),FSTP (fatal squad, traffic police) and TCC (traffic computer cell). The idea was to lessen the burden of thousands of cases lying pending for years together in one go on one hand, and allow people to settle their fines through a harassment-free legal mechanism on the other. The participation was overwhelming. More such lokadalats are being organised shortly. Thanks and regards.\nSupratim Sarkar\nJoint CP (Traffic)",

While it is obviously impossible to change the behavioural pattern and mindset  of close to 50,000 taxi-drivers overnight  merely through enforcement, strict vigil to the extent possible, surprise raids on a regular basis and prompt penal action do help in curbing the menace .During the course of special plain\u2013clothed raids by  KTP over the last 48 Hours, licences of 12 errant drivers have been seized for suspension and 31 prosecutions have been launched on basis of telephonic /SMS/FB complaints. \r\nSharing the pictures of a few offending drivers at Dharmatala crossing who were caught unawares by KTP.  Dear members, let us join hands in a crusade against the menace of taxi-refusals.

Both sides of the pavement are encroached with hawkers and no space is available on footpath for the pedestrian traffic. As a result, the pedestrian have to avail carriageway which is not desirable from traffic point of view. The matter is sensational in nature and needs to be taken up with the local administration. However, Kolkata Traffic Police is trying hard to keep the smooth flow of traffic in the vicinity.\nCo-operation from the local people is urgently required to improve the traffic circulation.",
